# Appendix

## A - repository reproducible master's thesis {#sec:reproducable_repo}
This folder on the digital storage contains the entire repository from which the master thesis was produced. This includes the markdown files, python code files, figures, documentation and the bash scripts for automating the whole process. All files in this repository have been produced by the author of this thesis unless stated otherwise. Also the digital version of the master's thesis is included in this repository. The folder *sections_in_progress* holds the files that needed code execution. These files also contain all the code that was written for the pipeline. Once these sections are executed the output of that process is stored in *sections_executed*. Also, some sections like the title, abstract or appendix are directly edited in *sections_executed* as these sections to not contain any code and therefore to not require execution. See @sec:execution in the appendix for how exactly files are executed.
