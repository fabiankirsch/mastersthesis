## C - Running unit tests {#sec:unittests}

To run the unit tests activate the conda environment containing the anaconda distribution (this should be either *kirsch* or *kirsch_gpu* following the instructions in @sec:local_setup) with `conda activate kirsch_gpu` in a terminal. Change directory to *accompanying_digital_storage:/Appendix A/code* and run `pytest` in the terminal. This will automatically execute all functions starting with 'test' in all python files which names start with 'test'.
